Hello Everyone !

- 🪐My Main Purposes
  <>I'm SafeCircle, and I'm currently leaarning 
    how to create games in the Game Maker Engine; (lol)

- ⚡Other Activities
  <>Since I like to Develop games, I've also learned how to
    use:
   -FL Studio (to compose music);
   -Aseprite (to create, and animate pixel arts);
  
- 🔭Hobbies
  <>As hobbies, right now I'm learning C++ and sometimes
    a bit of Assembly; (I'm going insane :>)
  <>I even love Math and I'm learning how to play the Piano
    (mostly Classic Music);
